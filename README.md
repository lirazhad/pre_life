On some platforms, Star Chart allows English speaking users to control Star Chart with Voice Commands. These voice commands are interpreted by the OS's Voice API. On Android, using the Voice API for voice commands requires us to ask all users in all territories to give permission for Star Chart to 'Record Audio'.

We do not collect any audio from your device unless you specifically trigger the voice command function, and we do not share that data with anyone else other than as required by the API to interpret the audio commands. For example, some voice command software sends audio command snippets to a server where they are analysed & interpreted before the results are returned to the app so that your commands can be actioned. The companies we currently use for voice recognition are Google and Microsoft - details on how these companies treat your voice data will have to be reviewed on their own sites.
